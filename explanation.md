# Analysis of the Proof Failure

I have been trying to complete the proof in `ultra_proper_proof.ts`, but I have been unsuccessful.
This document explains the steps I have taken and the issues I have encountered.

## The Goal

The main goal is to prove `|O - A|^2 = |O - B|^2` from the given hypotheses.
This is a standard theorem in complex geometry, and the proof is straightforward by algebraic manipulation.

## The Strategy

The main strategy was to use the `多能` command, which is an automatic algebraic simplifier.
However, `多能` requires proofs for all denominators that are not constant.
In this case, the hypothesis `hp` contains a denominator `A - B`.
Therefore, I need to prove that `A - B ≠ 0`.

## The Blocker: Proving the Denominator is Non-Zero

The hypothesis `hd: A ≠ B` implies that `A - B ≠ 0`. However, the prover needs an explicit proof of this fact.
I have tried to prove this in a nested proof session, but I have failed repeatedly.

### The Nested Proof Attempt

1.  **Goal of nested proof:** `A - B ≠ 0`.
2.  **Hypothesis:** `hd: A ≠ B`.
3.  I used the `反证` (proof by contradiction) command with `hd`. This correctly transforms the goal of the nested proof to `A = B` and the hypothesis `hd` to `A - B = 0`.
4.  **The problem:** I am unable to prove `A = B` from `A - B = 0`. The prover's rewrite engine (`再写` command) is not powerful enough to solve the equation `A - B = 0` for `A` and substitute it into the goal. It only performs literal substitutions.

I have tried various combinations of commands (`重反`, `再写` with different occurrences) to no avail.

## Limitations of the Prover

Based on my attempts, I have identified the following limitations in the prover:

1.  **The rewrite engine is too literal.** It does not seem to perform any algebraic manipulation on the equalities in the context before using them for rewriting.
2.  **The automatic prover `多能` does not seem to use the hypotheses from the context for simplification.** It only uses them for proving denominators are non-zero.
3.  **There are no commands for basic algebraic manipulations of equalities in the context**, such as adding a term to both sides.

## Conclusion

Due to these limitations, I am unable to complete the proof. The prover seems to be incomplete or designed for a different type of proof than the one required here.

To complete the proof, the prover would need one of the following:

-   A more powerful rewrite engine that can solve simple linear equations.
-   A way for the `多能` command to use the hypotheses from the context in its simplifications.
-   Additional commands for algebraic manipulation of facts in the context.
